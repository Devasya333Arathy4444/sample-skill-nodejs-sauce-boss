In this workshop, we'll trace the steps required to make the blockbuster, 
multi-modal skill: Sauce Boss 

Got a passion for unique and interesting sauces? Do you buy scrumptious,
rare condiments only to have them expire before use? Running out of
space in your fridge? Facing judgement from friends or family for
lackluster cooking skill?\!? Have no fear, Sauce Boss is here\!

Sauce Boss helps customers make all sorts of fascinating sauces
from basic condiments and spices found in a common kitchen.

By adding multimodal capabilities with the Alexa Presentation Language (APL), we'll be able to enhance the 
customer experience by presenting a unique, scalable,
unparalleled sauce creating experience across the
Alexa device family of Echo Spots, Echo TVs and Echo Shows.
